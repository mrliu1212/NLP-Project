It’s more racist by the left playing this card constantly and patronizing “poor black people” as if they aren’t intelligent, capable adults reasonable of rational responses that somehow instead need white leftists calling everything “racist” to “protect” them. If Democrats are truly concerned about racism , perhaps they should reign in the biggest racists in politics today like Omar and AOC, and have them shut up about derogatory comments about Jews, minimizing what concentration camps mean, and so forth.

In order for this to be viable, the company would have to prove significant returns of nearly double a standard bus firm to compete. Otherwise the opportunity costs / average costs of capital are far too high. You realize you can use economies of scale and still sell at below cost right? Economies of scale just mean lower costs due to producing significantly more with the same production systems. The reason larger firms can drive companies out of business is not just because they sell their product at cost to undercut other businesses but you also lose less $$ per product when you give it away for free or at absurdly low cost until your competitor must leave the market.

I said that, even if it was, I would have read the authors you were sure that I hadn’t read. Why am I here? Because I believe that we should always challenge our beliefs and try to understand what people who disagree with us think and why they think it. It’s the only way to grow as a person. It’s called personal growth. You’ve probably never heard of it. As for you? Yes, you’re a bigot, and an ass, but that’s not what bothers me.

First, the unborn cannot be recognized by the court as having any rights, as recognition of the unborn as a human being would make abortion an act of murder.

Because the government is on the hook for 99% of the treatment, doctors are incentivized to prescribe more drugs, and preform more operations. Additionally, they are more likely to increase the cost of treatments for patients across the board knowing that Medicare bureaucracy doesn't have the resources to fight back like many insurance companies have.

32717,The Indian Wars throughout the 18th and 19th century were abominable but those campaigns did not wipe out 100 million people. There was only an estimated 5 million to 15 million people living in North America when Columbus arrived in 1492. So that 100 million number is obviously false and meant purely to diminish the communism death toll. Most of the deaths of native Americans was due to the introduction of old world diseases. Most of those deaths occurred before the English established the 13 Colonies let alone the US expansion of the 18th and 19th centuries. The famous small pox blankets were used on one tribe of natives in the 19th century assuming the story is true. Not that anyone believes this troll but the fact that they are using lies to promote awareness of actual genocidal campaigns just weakens the argument to address those crimes. OP is actually helping those that want the native American deaths caused by US expansion to be glossed over and forgotten.,Libertarian

Also you should know that for every mass shooting there is more than 5 defensive uses of firearms. Your statement regarding vehicular homicide is true and you're welcome to use it, that doesn't mean it's relevant to the conversation of gun control. The **RELEVANT** statistic in that situation would be mass shootings. Although I still don't understand why we're discussing it but for my personal political viewpoint, I believe that we need an abundance of social programs to help the poor and disenfranchised survive but that can't come in the form of a ""living wage"" because that disincentives work which is something that the current democratic party of today doesn't get that they did understand in the past.
