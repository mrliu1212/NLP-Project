The prevailing opinion right now is 5 meals a day with most of your calories coming from carbohydrates is the healthiest choice. It's hard to think about a diet more fattening than constantly eating the stuff that makes your insulin spike (telling your body to store and not burn fat) Also, avoid fructose like the plague (table sugar is 50/50 glocuse/fructose, HFCS can be up to 90% fructose), if you don't get enough fiber with it it will overload your liver, cause insulin resistance and produce a bunch of the worst kind of fat."

13552,"Since I came to libertarianism (really consequentialist libertarianism) via economics, that's kind of what defines libertarianism for me. I think the best thing for you to do is to read a big fat book: Basic Economics by Thomas Sowell, a libertarianesque economist who studied under Nobel winners like Stigler and Friedman. You may be turned off because Sowell writes a Republicany political column (which I don't always agree with), but give Sowell the *author* a chance. This is not to say econ is inherently libertarian or even mostly libertarian, but since the 1970s it's become part of the mainstream spectrum of economic thought instead of purely heterodox (although Austrian school econ, a certain type of libertarian econ, is heterodox). If you're unwilling to read the big fat book, then you need to study standard microeconomics in some way to truly understand what has informed and guided most of modern libertarianism, IMO.

The idea is that once they are established, the tax breaks expire and then they're generating a bunch of additional tax revenue for the local government. When a real estate developer builds a new shopping center, they often offer reduced rent for the first few months to new tenants, with the idea that those tenants will stick around and ultimately pay a lot more than their initial discount. This is the same sort of thing on a larger scale. edit: Also, it's not welfare because the government is never giving the business any money.

The DSM-5 is a manual designed to help psychologists and psychiatrists treat psychological and psychiatric disorders, and it will use terminology helpful to that goal. It’s not a left-wing propaganda workbook. The meanings of its terminology may not be the exact same as what someone casually throws around. If your only evidence for your *political* points is a corrected entry in the DSM-5, it’s not very strong. The reason being is that there’s no reason to believe that that is influencing or is an indicator of the future goals or policy of anybody. Another analogy: just because we say we put our pets to sleep when we’re killing them, and our children to sleep when they go to bed, doesn’t mean anyone who says that is advocating euthanasia of children."

They only need to gain 1 seat for Pence to become a regular tie-breaker in the Senate, and that’s IF John McCain and Lindsey Graham don’t screw us over on a bill. 2 seats and those RINOs can start being good Republicans when it wouldn’t matter anymore. Meanwhile more House Republicans are retiring than House Democrats, including Trey Gowdy. Sure it’s not enough to give them a House majority but it would give them a little bit more power.

There's the theory that humans basically evolved to live in groups of several dozen, constantly overcoming truly existential problems (like having enough food) thorough cooperation. The further we get from that, the harder it is to attain happiness. The more trivial and the more individualized our work becomes (or at least *feels*) the more unsatisfying it is. On the former point, its more about how easily one can see the results of one's work. On the latter point, its just about being a part of a group. Whether that's a tribe or a team. Building houses with ten other guys is ultimately more satisfying than building excel spreadsheets by yourself. That's because you're working together with a group of people towards a clear goal, rather than working by yourself to do something that has no clear purpose other than to enable some other independent office automaton to do their job. Where capitalism does come into it is that it encourages this"

I suppose you could start an ice cream religion and only allow people you want, but I don't think it would hold up in court And the so called ""freedom of religion"" bills being introduced in state legislature are nothing more than an attempt to legalize bigotry. You don't like same sex marriage? Then don't marry someone of the same sex.

If it can be shown a ""news"" outlet is purposefully lying and deceiving that should be fined.

The AOH is not the Catholic Church, it is a social club with strong religious, ethnic and political ties. One of the foremost goals of the AOH is to push for the reunification of Ireland. While a bishop can be a part of the order, assuming they are of Irish decent, anything said by the bishop on behalf of the order, is done so on behalf of the order - not officially by the Catholic Church or the particular diocese.

That context is extremely important to a proper understanding of the 2017 rule change. I personally think that both rule changes are part of a troubling decades-long diminishing of the Senate's oversight power - and I believed this just as strongly when Obama was President - which is why I get a particular bugaboo when Democrats act like the Republican rule change came out of nowhere and Republicans act like the 2017 rule change just kept the status quo."

Case in point, credit card loans and payday loans routinely charge interest rates in the two-to-three digit range, despite Fed credit hoovering a point above zero. So this notion that we're ""juiced"" on credit doesn't bare out when you consider main street lending practices. > The Federal Reserve should not be treated the way the political world treats the federal courts and be regarded as untouchable by Congress.

I just want people to do what they want without the economic policies the left has, hence I fall under the category of libertarian. I think and classical macroeconomics will tell you that government intervention is often times at fault for many parts of our economy, economies thrive with lower taxes and less tariffs, with limited government there is less need for income and having lower taxes are achievable, and lack of tariffs is something that comes more naturally with the laissez faire nature of libertarianism.

The way I currently perceive these biases in America are, as follows: we have favored individual liberty over collective security; we have favored diffusion of power over concentration of power; and we have favored institutions' rigid permanence over their flexible responsiveness. You see these things in the founding philosophies of our country (""Those who desire safety over liberty deserve neither""), as well as the struggle in the balance of power between states vs. the federal government, and other such fields.

Mueller has honorably served as a federal prosecutor for the majority of his professional life, and received bipartisan praise throughout his career (including when he was appointed as special counsel). No one was accusing the FBI of being a bastion of liberalism when they were investigating Hillary Clinton (which was a legitimately important investigation). Trump and Sessions praised them for the work they were doing a year ago regarding that. While I definitely agree there are political motivations to any investigation, and I do definitely think Trumps comments on the Bureau and intelligence agencies have rubbed them the wrong way, to say the entire organization is an arm of the liberal movement is a bit of a stretch.

In 5 years the company would be rapidly contracting as our inertia wears off and the competition catches up. In 10 years we would be lucky to still be selling exist selling legacy parts.

So while I understand that pregnancies are not always good for the mother mentally, *physically* a pregnancy shouldn’t be considered the same as a sickness. To treat for cancer, infections, etc. would be to “fix” a body... to treat a body for an abortion is actually “breaking” the body... you’re taking what the body did and wants to do naturally and breaking that. in the case of healthy pregnancies, it’s not medically necessary to abort the baby whereas with a sickness, it is medically necessary to treat the illness.

It's very similar to the way nurses and doctors (and of course the armed forces) can develop awful coping habits to deal with the traumatic reality of what they see in their career. Doctors drink, nurses smoke, soldiers kill themselves, and police abuse their spouses. And all of them have some degree of subculture where they are more likely to cover for a coworker than protect a vulnerable person (although thankfully this is changing a lot in healthcare). I'm not sure what EMTs do to cope but their jobs certainly qualify them for bad coping habits. Anyway the point is that good cops aren't just sticking up for their buddies. They're struggling to c"

When your basic material needs are covered and you're no longer living paycheck to paycheck, being able to buy fancier stuff doesn't really move the needle.

It's hard to figure out exactly where contemporary democratic socialists stand so it's naive to assume most demsocs would side with revolutionaries. Most don't seem to have any firm theoretical grounding or ideas of how to overcome the roadblocks that stopped 20th century European socialist parties from actually moving past social democracy. All that said, I think reforms are a useful way to make people's lives better and build a coalition in the short term, even knowing that it has little to do with socialism. It's always a good thing to stop the far right, but many people further to the left see undue focus on electoralism and especially Democratic Party entryism as evidence that demsocs don't have a plan for ending capitalism or are happy to stop with reforms."

She admitted to it, too: Stewart: Do you have any information regarding any criminal activity that the president of the United States has been involved with at all?

And the fact that the investigation is still going on and the counter intelligence investigation was allowed to go on. Russian meddling happened under Obama's watch and the executive branch under Trump now is investigating what happened under Obama. Trump seems to care about it enough to let his administration continue to pursue an investigation, but he likely doesn't know enough and/or care enough to personally look at everything. He is the CEO of the US federal government. His job isn't to micromanage. As for continuously tweeting about a ""witch hunt"", he's obviously not referring to the investigation itself, rather the coverage of it. Perhaps that's why it doesn't seem like he cares."

Obviously these markets are subject to government interference in that they are completely forbidden, but equally this means that the players in these markets can not count on the government/law to enforce contracts. So, the most successful actors in these markets are violent cartels, who have their own methods of ensuring prompt payments and establishing monopolies. There is no government protectionism, quite the opposite, and yet still drug markets tend to be controlled by cartels and monopolies. (I'm aware I'm oversimplifying, and it could be argued that smaller players are more vulnerable to government harassment...it's interesting to think about.

Frankly I’d say it’s mostly the Biden voters who are uninformed because they get their ideas from talking points and fear mongers rather than stats or hard data. M4A is the most reasonable solution to this country’s healthcare problems. The only reason to oppose it is because it doesn’t benefit the wealthy and corporate America."

If the government got into laying fibre, though, it would do a much better job than private companies. It would serve people that it's not otherwise economical to serve, for starters, but it would also have an incentive to provide the best service at the lowest cost (even below cost) because the internet provides such a powerful social good, and (if you want an economic incentive) stimulates economic growth, which grows government coffers. By contrast, private ISPs are incentivized to provide the cheapest service at the highest price and to not serve anyone that it's not economical to serve, regardless of whether that would produce a societal benefit."

764,"There's the contrast between California and Kansas. That's both serious and well documented. I don't see that winning votes outside the respective states. I think we should roll back the spending on the DoD (and defense contractors) while keeping the money for social services and infrastructure. Sure a progressive tax on captial gains would benefit 98% of americans but the opposition will claim ""a tax on retirement"". That requires the average voter to have an attention span longer than trumps. i won't hold my breath. Shifting coalitions don't break political parties. There was a movement, it wasn't progressive or conservative, it was the old line of nationalism."
17171,"Bingo. I don't think that there is a ""libertarian"" Solution to homelessness in the Bay Area or CA in general. As a resident of CA with more libertarian beliefs it's difficult to not say ""everyone just take care of your own shit"" because, well frankly CA will never have that kind of solution. It's going to take enough of the population having to have the courage to stand against current tax spending and actually voting. CA seems primed for a good dose of bipartisan work ahead if King Newsom doesn't get too much in the way.Taxation is part of life, though we threw tea in the water over it years ago, we are dealt with having some sort of tax in life, and honestly that's okay because we need certain things the private industry either won't take care of, or most likely haven't found a solution to yet. The massive empty buildings in the South Bay could easily be converted to affordable housing but part of that is also a problem of the market. The local govts let foreign holding companies and investors buy up"

Or they won't and children will be born into homes that did not want them and/or are not able to support them, leading them to go on state welfare, driving up the cost! And the children will probably be neglected leading to crime spikes in the next 20 years! Not to mention that women won't have good preventative care so they have to be in hospitals where they have to pay thus taking money out of the economy!

A person works hard at a job for future comfort. Parents have no idea what the future holds, but they have faith that it will occur and that they can and will raise their children to be good people who respect others, etc. Also the ""golden rule"" existed before Christianity. Christianity isn't in a position to rebuke anyone else's beliefs: the intolerance, bloodshed, torture, conquest and destruction of innocent peoples in South American, Inquisition in Spain, the reduction of women to servants of men, the molestation of children, especially in the Catholic branch--and you dare to spit on atheism?

The employer can have whatever conditions that they want so long as the employee agrees to said conditions. If they don't, they are free to seek employment elsewhere. If the employers is unreasonable, then they will not find enough labor to operate and ultimately fail. If the employee is unreasonable, then they will fail at finding employment. Presumingly, a middle ground will be reached. That's how it works in a free market."
5248,Sadly I have seen the opposite in black churches. What really makes it sad is that the clergy is supposed to be more educated. They used to have at least the equivalent of a college degree. But for generations those better educated than most in the congregation have been lied to regarding politics. Just imagine a minister...doesn't matter what their color...preaching to the congregation....doesn't matter what their color....and preaching self responsibility and calling the police and assisting them to rid their neighborhood of the endless crime and violence.

And yes, balance bills are paid to out-of-state, out-of-network, unregulated providers because the ACA requires it on a federal level. Again, if you live in the US, regardless of which state you're in and where you go to the ER, that claim will be paid based on your in-network benefits. And if the provider was technically out-of-network and balance bills, your insurance company is obligated to pay for it."

And something like 85% of the children who feel that way grows out of those feelings. >And forcing them to go through puberty has a terrible effect on their mental health for years to come. Puberty blockers are temporary, and puberty starts up as normal after they are off of it. No. This is not true at all. Hormones are not something that just ""turn back on"" the day, week, month, or even year after stopping treatment. This is especially true when talking about the HPTA system. Messing with these hormones can cause severe issues, such as extreme depression and suicidal thoughts. This hormone axis doesn't just flip back on by itself every time as well. It is common for different drugs to be prescribed in order to make your body ""turn back on"" again such as clomid and HCG in order to turn on the male testes. Don't advocate for ""treatment"" that will actually make the main problem (suicide, for the group of people we're talking about) much worse. That's not ""treatment"" you're making"
32455,All the Russians did was provide information and troll both sides (admittedly the Democrats more). At least that is all that has been proven. Unless you are saying that the DNC had a back door to the elections systems to cheat and had the instructions on their server so when it was hacked the Russians gained access to that back door to influence the elections... Edit: Throwing out a joke about missing emails doesn't equal a request for a hack...the fact the russians were able to do it shows the incompetence of the DNC and why they shouldn't be in charge at this time.

And he pays more than much of America combined in taxes. Also, there is a difference between getting rich and creating value to the economy and community. You can get rich selling guns and drugs to school children. Being rich is often about luck. Not hard work. Often people who create work for others don't choose to enrich themselves. American discourse needs to remember the concept of virtue over value. Money is like nuclear energy. It depends on how you use it that makes you good or bad. If you are rich in America (e.g. have more than 10 Million in liquid assets - less isn't really rich) you have choices others don't have about the footprint you'll leave behind your time among us.

21302,"I hate it when people say ""transfer of wealth to the 1%"". That is just not true. Sorry, the 0.001%. Hyper-low interest rates allow banks to borrow at the overnight window with extremely little, then lend out to corporations or people. The banks take the margin. The people who benefit most from low interest rates are the wealthy. They borrow at obscenely low rates, then either re-loan it out, or use it to buy equity. Own a bank, bank borrows at 1%, loans money to your company at 3% on the condition that it be secured by shares in the bank. Your company buys shares of the bank that pay a 5% dividend yield. The bank makes the 2% margin on the loan, you make the 2% on the dividend. It's all gravy. If there's an issue? Your company declares bankruptcy, but you keep that 2% because you siphoned it off already. If there's a huge issue, the bank declares bankruptcy (and so does your company), you still keep that 2%. Everyone else is screwed though, because they personally owned the shares (or their pension"

Superstructure can only take you so far without a strong base, which takes decades of effort to build. It took the Clintons 40 years to build the Democratic establishment into a solidly centre-right, neoliberal monolith underneath them. And that was with them having the most wealthy, powerful backing available. It's outright silly, or just plain purposeful bad faith, to expect Sanders and the movement we're building to magically become powerful enough to consistently defeat the establishment overnight. Come back to me in 10 years, and if we haven't made considerable progress? Then you can make these posts."

Jesus one of the gyms I went to had the best equipment gated behind a cycle system (they have a specific area for this at PF as well) where you get booted off if you took up the machines for too long. Problem is, the rest of the area was free weights and isolation exercises are some of the only ways I can reliably work on certain muscles because the free weight versions are literally not possible without strict supervision. To top it off, you have a ton of people taking up the lighter weights just so they can work on aesthetics. So basically I have to compete for the most used weights while the competitive builders pretty much had the freedom to do whatever."

It's a treacherous path to take our country down, and would lead to an even more toxic and hyper-polarized society.

How can one base the salary of a teacher on merit when much of what the merit is based is out of their control? Some of my wife’s students come to school without bathing, some who don’t eat or sleep well, some with visible untreated medical conditions, some with visible injury from abuse, and some who should be diagnosed with learning disabilities or autism but their parents refuse to do it out of denial. They come from complete and utter dysfunction AT HOME which translates to dysfunction in the classroom. Many live with grandparents because mom is on drugs and dad (if the father is known) is often in jail. I don’t care if you had the teacher of the year teaching those kids, how do you get those kids to succeed at a level where you yourself can eat when there’s no parental involvement? Edit: To be clear, I’m not totally against merit pay. I just think there’s gotta be a better way to implement it. I do"

She does dress well, but part of her dressing the way she does is that she's not over fussy about her style. She does choose her outfit to add to the event she's attending, not something that will draw the attention away from the even and onto her. No matter what she wears, no matter how understated and appropriate, the press tears her style apart. This was the best jacket to wear while boarding the plane, considering the circumstances.

The left's answer is to increase the minimum wage, but that only further increases the costs for small businesses. Companies like Amazon know this and spend hundred of millions sending money to politicians who create laws, regulations and tax codes that ultimately help big business and raise the barrier for entry for small business.

What I’ve heard a lot of in the debates boils down to healthcare **access**, saying people die/suffer because they **can’t** afford something or are **denied** services. While there are certainly cost issues (big bills), people simply don’t **die** because of them unless they willingly **choose** not to go to a hospital because they’d literally rather die than get a hospital bill.

Later Marxists try to extend this critique to involve stuff like Adorno's mass culture, or Gramsci's hegemony but even then it still reduces down to a fundamental class conflict on the opposing sides of the ownership of the means of production. I know Marx wrote about slavery and colonialism, and that later Marxists extended that original critique, I simply disagree with the initial reduction. History is more than a battle between classes of people--and ultimately 'class consciousness' isn't *real*. No matter who the Marxist is, that would be a fundamental disagreement, and that's why I focus on it. And not, I am decidedly *not* saying rich people aren't responsible. I'm pointing to the fact that the idea the rich people are *solely*, and *ultimately*, and *consequentially* responsible is bunch of horseshit. Again we a"

Theres an argument to be made for both interpretations. One could argue nevertheless controls the entire clause. Effectively, like you said, one is liable to indictment before being impeached. There is an argument to be made that an indictment must wait until a party is impeached. The word convicted being in the past tense suggests that impeachment must precede indictment.

So, it's not exactly cut-and-dried that he was evading taxes on this transfer. His 709 for 2016 (upon filing...*if* filed) would show whether this transfer was accounted for.

3255,"ABC is lying, as the report is that Flynn is expected to testify he was instructed to contact the Russians by Trump senior staff... not Trump himself. Even CNN this morning was being very cautious of saying it implicated Trump, or that even if it did that it would be illegal. Since collusion isn't illegal, the only charge could be ""conspiracy"" and then they'd have to prove there was a conspiracy to do something that is against the law. They are simply dragging this out as long as they can to 2018 to try and use it to get midterm votes. They have nothing. Flynn has been outed as lying to Trump admin and let go because of it, so his credibility is no longer viable, despite having been a 3 star general."

As for changing it in Iowa - unless you're going to register to vote there, you'll still have to do it through Kansas.

There's no objective reason for any living thing to have rights; we make a social contract with each other to not do certain things to each other, like theft and murder. A human fetus is protected by the social contract by default, so it cannot be murdered. But a murderer forfeits his right to be protected by this contract, since he broke the contract himself."

The US dollar has also been getting weaker since the last peak in December of 2016. It's down about 12% in value since then, so that isn't a good explanation.

And it was not a different shooter, it was the same shooter, after he finished in Christchurch he drove to the second mosque, where he shot those people and was arrested.

I am calling you a nigger because of the way you act, not because of your skin color (a nigger thinks everyone owes them something, hates white people, etc). I don’t hate black people at all, and I actually have several black friends that also hate niggers.

But then again, rampant hypocrisy is present in the Christian faith as it is in any group of people. At least don’t pretend like every Christian is above it all. There are plenty of fart-sniffing Christians that have the same kind of piety as the most flagrant liberals. To pretend otherwise is dishonest.

To think that that is the safer, better course of action means that you're pretty desperate. My point is simply that the government is currently trying to close pretty much any means of coming here through the southern border. They are holding the health and well being of thousands of children at the border as hostages, to try and get democrats in congress to relent on changing the rules for asylum and building a wall. If they DO relent on those things, you can expect to see more people making this desperate, horrible choice in the future."

People are getting the social security checks, the military is still conducting operations, federal inspections are still happening. Shapiro said that 90% of government operations are continuing unabated. 2. The people most terrified by the shutdown are federal employees. Since so little is actually stopping, people outside of the beltway aren't really going to notice, but government employees at the capital are the *most* likely to notice. The problem with this is that The Washington Post will print this detail and not *Life Goes On in the Fifty States*. 3.

Blain got played in the first 3 preseason games while Kap did not dress for play in the first 2. Kap began his protest in that first preseason game. Blain was ultimately named starter for the season. Blain, a white man, basically got Kap's job. Then Kap started protesting about racist America.

Their works were not good in and of themselves, and they may have even had sinful motives. But because they have faith, they and their works have been covered by the blood of Christ.

You would need a constitutional amendment to make this happen. 2. It's extraordinarily unpopular, so good luck with that. 3. Even if you could ban 100% of all gun sales, there are still over 300,000,000 firearms in America. The black market for guns will be tremendous. 4. There's no indication this will actually work. See: France, where terrorists have carried out multiple attacks in recent years using weapons that are totally illegal, trafficked illegally into a country with much tighter gun laws and fewer guns than the USA.

It was a weird situation to make a hard sale, but they went for it. I paid the next day, got my MRI, had a massive brain tumor, and then dove into researching my condition and treatment.

Even in the last 50 years we've seen a huge swing of 'what marriage is' between men and women. The definition of one man and one woman wasn't even defined until the ninth century, previously polygamy was very prevalent among nobility. Even after monogamy was set, the rules for both parties were very different allowing for men's promiscuity to continue while setting very harsh rules for women who did the same. To say what marriage is hasn't changed is a huge misnomer. They started as arranged alliances, typically to strengthen family ties. Thank goodness we've evolved from our parents marrying us off to their sibling's children. Now it's about love, strengthening social ties, and those sweet tax bennies ^/s ."

The campaign you win by making the most absurd promises, the 2nd phase you win by staying as true to them as possible.

Since you're having apparent difficulty with the paragraph I wrote, here's a summary: Corruption is the only legitimate explanation for the explosion in the Dean/Teacher Ratio since the 1960's despite the explosion of technology that replaces the tasks Deans were originally supposed to be doing. This is a long term trend that has nothing whatsoever to do with Trump. Unless you can provide an counterargument, a legitimate explanation for why so many more Deans are now needed, your post is a shitpost."

I'm a Libertarian and gay marriage is fine by me. The country was build upon Christian values. Our laws are based on Christian values. I feel, as do most conservatives, that those values are what binds together our society. That's my opinion. The travel ban is not a Muslim Travel Ban. That's silly. If it were a Muslim Travel Ban, why would it only ban about 20% of the Muslim population. Math makes that an invalid argument.

37482,"No, that is wrong. Collectivism is a very specific term referring to the denial of individual agency, rights, representation or innocence due to the percieved collective they are part of. Collectivism is the antonym of individualism. Individualism is the idea that the individual is central and of highest importance, and no infringement may be made upon an innocent individual for any cause. Any individual should be considered as their own separate entity in almost all aspects. Basically, individualism is the notion that gave birth to the enlightenment, to liberalism and to the constitution you hold so dear. Collectivism, is, of course, the opposite. It is a world view in which the collective is central, and it states that: 1. the innocent may be infringed upon for the good of the collective and 2. Your actions and that of the collective are completely interchangeable in terms of guilt and accountability.

The difference is that there are more black families in the lower class, especially proportionally, and this could be a self perpetuating situation, not one we can totally blame on the people themselves.

First off, the confederacy was not the first nation to be built on the institution of slavery. It wasn't even close. Brazil comes to mind as one of the big ones, and they made slavery in the United States look like amiture hour in comparison with how much larger their slave trade and use of salves was compared to ours. And secondly, slavery in the south would have probably ended sooner then you think. The Upper South, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, and North Caroline, were already starting to industrialize which would have made slavery less financially important and eventually useless like in the North. Also cash crops in The south we're starting to change. In the Upper South cash crops like tobacco or cotton were starting to be replaced by less labor intensive crops like peanuts which didn't need as many laborors and were less conducive to slaves.

2583,Libertarianism has its flaws. I can never endorse the same philosophy the friend who introduced me to it has. She's basically an anarchist. But from my own research this is a better system. All evidence points me this direction.
5969,"Well I appreciate the clarification but my point remains the same. Words matter. The chief arguments against “free health care” and “free education” and the many other social programs provided by the government are that they’re not really free. And they’re not. They’re incredibly expensive. But they save or produce more money in the long run when you have an educated and healthy population. So say that, then begin the conversation from a place of honesty as opposed to using divisive bumper sticker politics. So long as the right keeps running to the right, and the left keeps running left and they keep yelling “but they started it”. The rest of us are going to continually get screwed over."
19345,What will be your excuse when it is?
25080,Neither did I. After all it is a community and not a single entity . I'm just saying there is a reason there is such a big subscriber gap in the two subs and that reason is not the ideologies they represent but the environments they have.

There's still a lot of that there, but it's not what I would call ""the smart left""'s position."

1998,"Because the Democrat Party is full of corrupt politicians fleecing the country for decades and fully hate the actual original meaning of the constitution. The Republican party was full of egotistical power hungry politicians with no backbone or solid constitutional ideals. Both parties were in cahoots, but sometimes a bright lights came along the way like Reagan. Then Rush Limbaugh came around and conservative talk radio woke us up day by day. It got stronger over the last 30 years with millions more listening each year. The internet democracized information and thoughts and ideas were shared. Our elected politicians lagged in the movement. But as the institutions in America became more and more corrupt and publicly polluted, it was obvious something needed to change. The manchurian candidate called Obama lied his way to victory and convinced white voters that racial animosity of which Jackson/Sharpton were famous for stoking, could be ameliorated. End white guilt. But the opposite is what we found"

37002,"There are plenty of solutions coming from the left. News flash - Republicans have been sabotaging these programs for years trying to make it look like they're unsustainable to convince people like you we can't afford them and they're bad for us. It's a lie. Republicans haven't been looking to solve problems in these systems, they've been looking to exacerbate them so that the public will be in favor of cutting them and they can give their rich pals lots of tax cuts in the name of ""job creation."" Seriously, Google ""Republicans sabotaged obamacare"" sometime - you will find articles from reputable news sources going back years going into detail on how they're trying to make this system seem ineffective and expensive, they're not helping anything, they're hurting it."

15250,"In the face of rampant foreign interference in elections by fascists worldwide, Maduro was forced to take these extraordinary measures to maintain his countries sovereignty. He could not cede power to an American rigged assembly. The fascists made his actions necessary. If he had not done what he did Venezualana would be under a fascist dictatorship right now. Genocides would be being planned and the poor would be starving to death in greater numbers so that the American empire could get more oil. Venezuala is literally at war, the fascists are struggling to take this last bastion of democracy in the western hemisphere down so that they will have total control. This is not the time for another election. A unity wartime government needs to be formed, consisting of all sides loyal to Venezuela, to deal with these challenges as the fascists siege them from all sides and starve their citizens to force them to acquiesce. Venezuala must not fall! Venezuala must stay steady through the fascist siege! This is the"

26147,I think that the problem with Leftists is that they are incapable of understanding non-leftwing positions and opinions. The reason their fake hate crimes are so obvious is that they can't imitate a rightwing voice/opinion. If we wanted to fake a hate crime by the Left we could easily because we understand their positions and have heard their opinions. All they know of us comes from leftwing produced media.

38837,"The thing is: Warren actually cares about the proper tax schedule for a healthy economy and is actually interested in making a consistent budget. So when she releases plans (like her wealth tax plan or her education plan) she ensures they are real sustainable policy. Medicare For All as written will save money for those who are currently on health plans but cost more for those who currently have no plan. In other words, it rewards privilege. Sanders plans to fight that with a deep progressive income tax, which is not a part of M4A but a separate policy. Warren has chosen to fight the growing inequality with her taxation plan and so has a wealth tax as central to her strategy. As Piketty and other economists have shown, you cannot fight inequality with income taxes as they do not touch the stored wealth at all. So Warren is looking to announce a payment plan that integrates with her economic strategy and does not harm the disadvantaged as blanket M4A support would. That’s responsible leadership, not “secre"

12595,"And once again it’s not a contract in the way you are saying. It’s not something you sign. **It’s the philosophical explanation for the reason society arises.** Possession means that if I take you car it is by al right mine. That’s is your claim that theft creates ownership, since at that point you have not defended you possession. If you take me to some *authority* and prove that you have an ownership right over your car than it is property. The significant difference is the recognization from society at large that you own something, without that all you can do it protected it by yourself. You have no argument because haven’t read the source material which makes you ignorant on the subject matter. That’s not name calling, that’s calling an apple and apple. You can’t even enforce signed contracts without everyone agreeing signed contracts are valid. (Which even now they are not always, “worth the piece of paper it printed on”)You can’t just claim things, I’ll claim your car when you are inside, as I have"
